# Detection of Idiomaticity in Sentences using Transfomer Models
This project presents a study on idiomaticity detection using transformer models. Idiomatic phrases, also known as idioms, are fixed expressions that cannot be understood from the meanings of the individual words. Traditional methods for idiomatic phrase detection rely on rule-based approaches or lexical databases, but these methods have limitations in terms of coverage and accuracy. The use of transformer models and Siamese network architecture offers the potential for improved performance by leveraging large amounts of data and the ability to capture complex relationships between words in two languages. To improve the performance of the models, a stacked ensemble is created using DistilBERT, RoBERTa, and XLNET. The results show that the proposed approach achieved high accuracy in idiomaticity detection, demonstrating the effectiveness of transformer models and the ensemble technique in this task. The goal of this project is to develop and evaluate models that can accurately detect idiomatic phrases in natural language text.
